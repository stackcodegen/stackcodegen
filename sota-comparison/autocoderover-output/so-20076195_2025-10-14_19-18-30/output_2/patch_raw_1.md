The issue described is related to the inefficiency of counting occurrences in a large DataFrame using `groupby` and `count()` which can be slow for large datasets. An optimized way to achieve this is to use the `value_counts()` method in pandas which is typically faster for counting unique values.

This patch will demonstrate using `value_counts()` as a more efficient way to count word occurrences. 

Here is the needed modification:

# modification 1
```
<file>45416684.py</file>
<original>
Occurrences_of_Words = word_grouping[['word']].count().reset_index()
</original>
<patched>
Occurrences_of_Words = df['word'].value_counts().reset_index()
Occurrences_of_Words.columns = ['word', 'count']
</patched>
```

### Explanation:
- The original code uses `groupby` and `count()` which is inefficient for large DataFrames.
- The patched code utilizes `value_counts()`, which is a more efficient method provided by pandas for counting occurrences of unique values in a Series.
- After obtaining the counts, we reset the index to turn the Series back into a DataFrame and rename the columns appropriately.

This minimal change ensures the efficient counting of occurrences without affecting the overall functionality of the program.
