# Reasoning
To address the issue of counting occurrences in a large DataFrame efficiently, we should use the `value_counts()` method rather than grouping and counting. `value_counts()` is optimized for this kind of operation in pandas and should provide significant performance improvements for large datasets.

In the provided code context, there is no direct reference to the primary DataFrame `df` used in the issue description. I'll add a new snippet demonstrating how to use `value_counts()` for this specific issue.

# Patch

```
<file>45416684.py</file>
<original>
Occurrences_of_Words = word_grouping[['word']].count().reset_index()
</original>
<patched>
Occurrences_of_Words = df['word'].value_counts().reset_index()
Occurrences_of_Words.columns = ['word', 'Occurrences']
</patched>
```

This patch replaces the groupby operation with `value_counts()`, which is more efficient for counting occurrences in a DataFrame. The new lines count the occurrences of each word in the 'word' column and then reset the index. The resulting DataFrame's columns are renamed for clarity.
