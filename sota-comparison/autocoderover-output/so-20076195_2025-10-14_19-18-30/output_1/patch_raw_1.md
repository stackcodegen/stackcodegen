Given the issue described, we need to make the word counting more efficient in the large DataFrame, and the suggested `.value_counts()` method is a suitable choice in the Pandas library for such operations. This method is optimized for performance when counting occurrences.

Here is the patch:

# modification 1
```python
<file>27488446.py</file>
<original>
Occurrences_of_Words = word_grouping[['word']].count().reset_index()
</original>
<patched>
Occurrences_of_Words = df['word'].value_counts().reset_index()
Occurrences_of_Words.columns = ['word', 'count']
</patched>
```
