To address the performance issue in counting occurrences of words in the large DataFrame, we will replace the inefficient groupby('word').count() approach with the more efficient pandas' .value_counts() method. This change will only impact the code related to counting occurrences, thus ensuring minimal changes and maintaining the existing functionality.
