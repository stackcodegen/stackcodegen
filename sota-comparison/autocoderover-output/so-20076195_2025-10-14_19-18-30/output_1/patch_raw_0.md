To resolve the issue efficiently, we will replace the current approach of counting occurrences using the `groupby` method with the more efficient `value_counts` method provided by Pandas. The `value_counts` method is optimized for this type of operation and should significantly improve performance for large data frames.

Here is the patch:

# modification 1
```
<file>27488446.py</file>
<original>
Occurrences_of_Words = word_grouping[['word']].count().reset_index()
</original>
<patched>
Occurrences_of_Words = df['word'].value_counts().reset_index()
Occurrences_of_Words.columns = ['word', 'occurrences']
</patched>
```

Reasoning:
- The `.value_counts()` method directly counts the occurrences of each unique value in a Series and is optimized for this purpose.
- We then reset the index to convert it back to a DataFrame and rename the columns to match the expected output format.
  
This change will significantly enhance the performance of counting word occurrences in a large DataFrame.
