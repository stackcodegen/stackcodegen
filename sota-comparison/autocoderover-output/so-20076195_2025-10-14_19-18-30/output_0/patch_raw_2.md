The issue at hand is the inefficient computation of the occurrences of words using a `groupby` and `count` operation in a large DataFrame. We can optimize this by using the `value_counts` method, which is much faster for counting occurrences.

Here is the patch:

# modification 1
```
<file>27488446.py</file>
<original>
Occurrences_of_Words = word_grouping[['word']].count().reset_index()
</original>
<patched>
Occurrences_of_Words = df['word'].value_counts().reset_index()
Occurrences_of_Words.columns = ['word', 'Occurrences']
</patched>
```
This changes the approach from using `groupby` and `count` to using `value_counts`, which is specifically designed for this kind of task and performs better on large DataFrames. Note that we also rename the columns to match the original expected output format.
