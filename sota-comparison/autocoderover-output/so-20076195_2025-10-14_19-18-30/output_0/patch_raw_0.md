To address the issue of counting occurrences in pandas more efficiently, we can use the `value_counts()` function, which is optimized for such operations in large DataFrames. The `groupby` and `count` methods are generally slower for this kind of task.

Let's write the patch accordingly.

# modification 1
```
<file>your_script.py</file>
<original>
word_grouping = df[['word','frequency']].groupby('word')
MaxFrequency_perWord = word_grouping[['frequency']].max().reset_index()
MaxFrequency_perWord.columns = ['word','MaxFrequency']

Occurrences_of_Words = word_grouping[['word']].count().reset_index()
</original>
<patched>
word_grouping = df[['word','frequency']].groupby('word')
MaxFrequency_perWord = word_grouping[['frequency']].max().reset_index()
MaxFrequency_perWord.columns = ['word','MaxFrequency']

Occurrences_of_Words = df['word'].value_counts().reset_index()
Occurrences_of_Words.columns = ['word', 'Occurrences']
</patched>
```

This patch modifies the original code to use `value_counts()` for counting occurrences, which is much more efficient for large DataFrames. The rest of your code remains unchanged, maintaining the necessary transformations for getting maximum frequencies.
