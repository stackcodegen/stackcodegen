My thinking was to do one of the following:</p>\n\n<p>Use corepy, preferably with some optimizations\n  Recompile numpy with icc &amp; ikml.\n  Use python-cuda.</p>\n\n<p>I was wondering if anyone had any experience with any of these approaches ( what sort of gain would be typical, and if it is worth the time ), or if anyone is aware of a better library to perform convolution with Numpy.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Speed up of about 10x by re-writing python loop in C over using Numpy. </p>\n"
