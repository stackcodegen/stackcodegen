Certainly! Below is your `reproducer.py` script that reproduces the issue and prints a stack trace if the issue is present. This script will also exit with code 0 when fixed.

```python
import numpy as np
import sys

def print_stacktrace(e: Exception):
    import traceback
    tb = traceback.extract_tb(e.__traceback__)
    print("Traceback (most recent call last):", file=sys.stderr)
    for frame in tb:
        line_number = frame.lineno
        code_context = frame.line.strip() if frame.line else "Unknown"
        print(f'  File "{frame.filename}"', file=sys.stderr)
        print(f"    {line_number}: {code_context}", file=sys.stderr)
    print(f"{e.__class__.__name__}: {e}", file=sys.stderr)

try:
    a = np.array([1, 2, np.NaN])
    b = np.array([1, 2, np.NaN])

    assert np.all(a == b), "Arrays are not identical"
except AssertionError as e:
    print_stacktrace(e)
    sys.exit(1)

sys.exit(0)
```

Place the code above in a file named `reproducer.py`. Here is a brief explanation of how the script works:

1. It imports the necessary modules.
2. It defines the `print_stacktrace` function to display stack trace information clearly.
3. It constructs two numpy arrays, `a` and `b`, both containing NaN.
4. It uses an `assert` statement to check if all elements in the two arrays are equal. Since `NaN != NaN`, this will raise an `AssertionError`.
5. If an `AssertionError` is raised, the stack trace is printed, and the script exits with code 1.
6. If the check passes (i.e., when the issue is fixed), the script exits with code 0.

To run the script, simply execute:
```sh
python3 reproducer.py
```
