Right now, my code looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Ui_MainWindow(QtGui.QMainWindow):\n    def __init__(self):\n        QtGui.QMainWindow.__init__(self)\n        self.setupUi(self)\n    def setupUi(self, MainWindow):\n        #setup code goes here\n    def retranslateUi(self, MainWindow):\n        #re translation of the GUI code\n    def closeEvent(self, event):\n        print \"User has clicked the red x on the main window\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In a seperate \"main\" file I have the folowing: </p>\n\n<pre><code>class GUIForm(QtGui.QMainWindow):\n    def __init__(self, parent=None):\n        QtGui.QMainWindow.__init__(self,parent)\n        self.ui = Ui_MainWindow()\n        self.ui.setupUi(self)\n        #self.ui.ECUStatus_txt = MyWidget.__init__.text_list\n        self.threadData()\n\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n        app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)\n        myapp = GUIForm()\n        myapp.show()\n        ret = app.exec_()\n        sys.exit(ret)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, when I run via command prompt, I am not able to see the print statement when I hit the red x. I know I am new to Qt, but I have seen quite a few people ask this question, and none of the answers seemed to get beyond what is already written above. </p>\n\n<p>One of these answers:\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9249500/pyside-pyqt-detect-if-user-trying-to-close-window\">Answer #1</a>\n<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20895645/how-to-have-a-pyqt-window-call-a-method-when-its-x-close-button-is-selected\">Answer #2</a></p>\n\n<p>Both of these solutions are similar to mine, but it still doesn't work</p>\n\n<p>Despite the answer, which may have worked for that user's specific code, my fellow PyQt colleagues and I are still quite foggy on the reasoning ours is not working. Is there a defined button name for the \"Red X box\" built into PyQt?  Can I connect it to another function the someway I would for other buttons?</p>\n"
