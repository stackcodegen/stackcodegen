Remember that you're writing the condition in terms of what you want to <em>keep</em>, not in terms of what you want to drop.  For <code>df1</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>df1 = df[(df.a != -1) &amp; (df.b != -1)]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You're saying \"keep the rows in which <code>df.a</code> isn't -1 and <code>df.b</code> isn't -1\", which is the same as dropping every row in which at least one value is -1.</p>\n\n<p>For <code>df2</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>df2 = df[(df.a != -1) | (df.b != -1)]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You're saying \"keep the rows in which either <code>df.a</code> or <code>df.b</code> is not -1\", which is the same as dropping rows where both values are -1.</p>\n\n<p>PS: chained access like <code>df['a'][1] = -1</code> can get you into trouble.  It's better to get into the habit of using <code>.loc</code> and <code>.iloc</code>.</p>\n\n  **patched_code_intent:**\n  The code aims to filter a DataFrame based on specific conditions using logical AND and OR operators while avoiding SettingWithCopyWarning by using proper indexing methods.\n\n"
