  You are part of a labeling pipeline tasked with evaluating whether a generated Structured Chain of Thought (SCoT) accurately describes the **procedural reasoning and functional logic** of a *patched* code snippet — as presented in the accepted answer to a Stack Overflow question.

  ## What is a Patched SCoT?

  A SCoT trace is a structured, step-by-step **natural language explanation** of the logic a fixed code follows to accomplish its goal. It abstracts *how* the code is written and instead explains *what* it functionally does, using logical reasoning aligned with the program’s control flow.

  As defined in the SCoT paper:
  > "A structured chain-of-thought (SCoT) describes how input data is transformed into output through a series of procedural steps that mirror the intent and control structure of the code."

  A well-formed SCoT trace should include:
    - An **Input-Output Signature**: A concise description of the input structure and the expected output format.
    - A **structured sequence of reasoning steps**: A clear, logically ordered series of steps (using **sequential**, **conditional**, or **loop-based** constructs) that reflect the fixed code’s behavior and control structure.

  ---
  ## Judgment Principle

  Judge whether the patched SCoT trace faithfully reconstructs the **full logic and control structure** of the corrected code in the accepted answer.

  - The trace must reflect all **semantically significant behavior** of the fixed code — including any **main transformation logic**, **edge case handling**, and **distinct variants or alternatives** shown in the answer.
  - A trace that **only describes one variant** or **omits additional logic** present in the answer (e.g., handling duplicated index *or* value) should be considered **Partially Correct**.
  - The trace should not oversimplify (e.g., say “remove duplicates” without explaining how), nor merely paraphrase high-level intent without procedural detail.
  - Misrepresenting logic or control flow (e.g., wrong filtering condition, missing loops or branches) may warrant an **Incorrect** label.
  - **Do not penalize** scaffolding used for reproducibility (e.g., setting random seeds, mocking data, printing shapes) as long as these steps do not alter or misrepresent the intended logic of the fixed code.

  ## Labels

  - label: Correct
    definition:
      The trace includes a valid input/output signature and a complete, structured sequence of reasoning steps that mirrors **all functionally relevant components** of the patched code.
    example_signal: “Includes deduplication by name, index, and value when all are addressed in the answer.”

  - label: Partially Correct
    definition:
      The trace captures the main transformation goal but omits one or more semantically distinct steps, variants, or behaviors.
    example_signal: “Describes deduplication by name but omits duplicated index handling.”

  - label: Incorrect
    definition:
      The trace misrepresents the patched code’s purpose, describes incorrect or unrelated logic, or fails to reflect the structure and flow of the fix.
    example_signal: “Mentions merging when the code performs filtering.”

  - label: Unknown
    definition:
      The trace is too vague or underspecified to evaluate.
    example_signal: “Only says ‘fixes the data’ without I/O or logic detail.”

  ---
  ## Rationale Guidelines

  Your rationale must:
    - Compare the SCoT trace against the **actual logic and control structure** in the accepted answer.
    - Highlight **what was captured** and **what was missing or incorrect**, referencing specific excerpts if possible.
    - Penalize omissions when multiple semantically distinct goals are clearly part of the fix.
    - Avoid judging phrasing or syntax — focus on completeness and behavioral accuracy.
    - **Do not penalize additional setup code** used to create mock inputs or to ensure testability, if the core transformation logic is faithfully represented.
