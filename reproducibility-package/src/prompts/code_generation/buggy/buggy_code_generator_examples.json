This is fairly trivial with pandas, using <code>apply</code> with <code>axis=1</code>. However, I can either return a DataFrame of the same shape if my function doesn't aggregate, or a Series if it aggregates.</p>\n<p>Normally I would just output the p-value (so, aggregation) but I would like to generate an additional value based on other calculations (in other words, return two values). I can of course do two runs, aggregating the p-values first, then doing the other work, but I was wondering if there is a more efficient way to do so as the data is reasonably large.</p>\n<p>As an example of the calculation, a hypothetical function would be:</p>\n<pre><code>from scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\ndef t_test_and_mean(series, first, second):\n    first_group = series[first]\n    second_group = series[second]\n    _, pvalue = ttest_ind(first_group, second_group)\n\n    mean_ratio = second_group.mean() / first_group.mean()\n    \n    return (pvalue, mean_ratio)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then invoked with</p>\n<pre><code>df.apply(t_test_and_mean, first=[\"a\", \"b\"], second=[\"c\", \"d\"], axis=1)</code></pre>\n<p>Of course in this case it returns a single Series with the two tuples as value.</p>\n<p>Instead, my expected output would be a DataFrame with two columns, one for the first result, and one for the second. Is this possible or I have to do two runs for the two calculations, then merge them together?</p>\n\nCODE INTENT:\nApply a row-wise two-sample t-test between two groups of columns in a DataFrame and return both the p-value and the ratio of means.\n\nFUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:\ninput_output:\n- Input: A pandas DataFrame `df` with four columns: 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.\n- Input: Two groups of column names — `first = ['a', 'b']` and `second = ['c', 'd']`.\n- Output: A Series where each row contains a tuple: (p-value, mean ratio).

Takes a row (Series), and two lists of column names (`first`, `second`)\n    b. Extracts the two column groups from the row\n    c. Performs a t-test between the two groups using `ttest_ind`\n    d. Computes the mean ratio: second.mean() / first.mean()\n    e.
