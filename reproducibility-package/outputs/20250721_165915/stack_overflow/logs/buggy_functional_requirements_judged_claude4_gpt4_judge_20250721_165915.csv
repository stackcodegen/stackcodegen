"20076195","What is the most efficient way of counting occurrences in pandas?
<p>I have a large (about 12M rows) DataFrame <code>df</code>:</p>
<pre><code>df.columns = ['word','documents','frequency']
</code></pre>
<p>The following ran in a timely fashion:</p>
<pre><code>word_grouping = df[['word','frequency']].groupby('word')
MaxFrequency_perWord = word_grouping[['frequency']].max().reset_index()
MaxFrequency_perWord.columns = ['word','MaxFrequency']
</code></pre>
<p>However, this is taking an unexpectedly long time to run:</p>
<pre><code>Occurrences_of_Words = word_grouping[['word']].count().reset_index()
</code></pre>
<p>What am I doing wrong here?  Is there a better way to count occurrences in a large DataFrame?</p>
<pre><code>df.word.describe()
</code></pre>
<p>ran pretty well, so I really did not expect this <code>Occurrences_of_Words</code> DataFrame to take very long to build.</p>

    ""edge_cases"": ""- The user may not realize that counting on a grouped column that was used for grouping is redundant and inefficient.\n- Using `.count()` on the grouping column itself may cause performance issues or unexpected behavior.\n- The user might not be aware that `value_counts()` or `size()` could be more appropriate for counting occurrences.""

}","Correct","The functional requirements accurately capture the user's expectations and misunderstandings as described in the Stack Overflow question. The `input_output` section correctly identifies the input as a large DataFrame with specific columns and the desired output as a DataFrame counting word occurrences. The `expected_behavior` section reflects the user's approach of using `groupby('word')` and `.count()` to count occurrences, and their expectation that this should be efficient based on previous operations. The `edge_cases` section appropriately highlights the user's potential misunderstanding of the inefficiency of counting on the grouping column itself and suggests more efficient alternatives like `value_counts()` or `size()`. Overall, the functional requirements comprehensively reflect the user's expectations and misunderstandings.","1","{
