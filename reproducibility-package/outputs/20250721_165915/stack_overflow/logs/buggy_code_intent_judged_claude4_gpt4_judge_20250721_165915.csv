"20076195","What is the most efficient way of counting occurrences in pandas?
<p>I have a large (about 12M rows) DataFrame <code>df</code>:</p>
<pre><code>df.columns = ['word','documents','frequency']
</code></pre>
<p>The following ran in a timely fashion:</p>
<pre><code>word_grouping = df[['word','frequency']].groupby('word')
MaxFrequency_perWord = word_grouping[['frequency']].max().reset_index()
MaxFrequency_perWord.columns = ['word','MaxFrequency']
</code></pre>
<p>However, this is taking an unexpectedly long time to run:</p>
<pre><code>Occurrences_of_Words = word_grouping[['word']].count().reset_index()
</code></pre>
<p>What am I doing wrong here?  Is there a better way to count occurrences in a large DataFrame?</p>
<pre><code>df.word.describe()
</code></pre>
<p>ran pretty well, so I really did not expect this <code>Occurrences_of_Words</code> DataFrame to take very long to build.</p>
