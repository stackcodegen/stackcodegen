"20076195","What is the most efficient way of counting occurrences in pandas?
<p>I have a large (about 12M rows) DataFrame <code>df</code>:</p>
<pre><code>df.columns = ['word','documents','frequency']
</code></pre>
<p>The following ran in a timely fashion:</p>
<pre><code>word_grouping = df[['word','frequency']].groupby('word')
MaxFrequency_perWord = word_grouping[['frequency']].max().reset_index()
MaxFrequency_perWord.columns = ['word','MaxFrequency']
</code></pre>
<p>However, this is taking an unexpectedly long time to run:</p>
<pre><code>Occurrences_of_Words = word_grouping[['word']].count().reset_index()
</code></pre>
<p>What am I doing wrong here?  Is there a better way to count occurrences in a large DataFrame?</p>
<pre><code>df.word.describe()
</code></pre>
<p>ran pretty well, so I really did not expect this <code>Occurrences_of_Words</code> DataFrame to take very long to build.</p>
","<p>I think <code>df['word'].value_counts()</code> should serve. By skipping the groupby machinery, you'll save some time. I'm not sure why <code>count</code> should be much slower than <code>max</code>. Both take some time to avoid missing values. (Compare with <code>size</code>.)</p>

<p>In any case, value_counts has been <a href=""https://github.com/pydata/pandas/commit/d1a1fa27e520c0d196981df58edb1bd5d3cc3161"">specifically optimized</a> to handle object type, like your words, so I doubt you'll do much better than that.</p>

}","Correct","The functional requirements accurately capture the behavior of the fixed code as described in the accepted answer. 

1. **Input/Output**: The requirements specify that the input is a DataFrame with a 'word' column containing string values, and the output is a Series with word values as index and their occurrence counts as values. This matches the use of `value_counts()` on the 'word' column, which is the solution provided in the answer.

2. **Expected Behavior**: The requirements describe using the `value_counts()` method to count occurrences of each unique word, noting that it bypasses the groupby machinery and is optimized for object types like strings. This aligns with the answer's explanation that `value_counts()` is specifically optimized for this task and provides better performance than using `groupby` with `count()`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The requirements mention that `value_counts()` automatically handles missing values and is optimized for object data types, which is consistent with the answer's emphasis on the method's optimization for handling large DataFrames efficiently.

Overall, the functional requirements fully and accurately reflect the corrected behavior as described in the accepted answer.","1","{
